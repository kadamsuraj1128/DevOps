robocopy %Destination% D:\workflow /E  /IS /MOVE /XD D:\Automation\source \move \R:100000000 /W:60
 
Meaning of above line in detail 
==============================================================================================
Here's a breakdown of each part of the command you provided:
 
robocopy %DeploymentFiles% D:\workflow /E /IS /MOVE /XD D:\automation\api /move /R:100000000 /W:60
 
1. robocopy
Starts the robocopy command, a powerful file copy/move utility in Windows.
 
 
2. %DeploymentFiles% Represents the source folder to copy from. This is an environment variable that holds the path of the source directory. Make sure %DeploymentFiles% is set in your environment variables, or it should be defined earlier in the script like this:
 
set "DeploymentFiles=C:\path\to\source_folder"
 
 
3. D:\workflow Specifies the destination folder to copy to. In this case, D:\workflow is where the files and folders will be moved.
 
 
4. /E Copies all subdirectories, including empty ones, from the source to the destination. This ensures the entire directory structure is included in the move.
 
 
5. /IS Includes files that have the same size and timestamp in the operation. Without /IS, robocopy might skip files in the destination that match those in the source. Using /IS forces these "same" files to be included.
 
 
6. /MOVE Moves files and folders from the source to the destination, deleting them from the source after copying. This is useful for transferring files while cleaning up the original location.
 
 
7. /XD D:\automation\api Excludes the directory D:\automation\api from the operation. If this folder exists within the source, it and its contents will be skipped. You can specify multiple directories after /XD by separating them with spaces.
 
 
8. /move This is a duplicate of /MOVE and doesn’t need to be repeated here. robocopy will ignore the duplicate, but removing it from the command will make it cleaner.
 
 
9. /R:100000000 Sets the retry count to 100,000,000. If robocopy encounters an error copying a file, it will retry up to this many times before giving up. Setting such a high retry count is unusual and could potentially cause robocopy to hang if files can’t be accessed. A lower number (like /R:5 or /R:10) is more common.
 
 
10. /W:60 Sets the wait time between retries to 60 seconds. If robocopy encounters an issue copying a file, it will wait 60 seconds before each retry. This helps avoid immediate repeated attempts that might fail if the file is temporarily unavailable.
 
 
 
Cleaned-Up Version
 
Here’s a more typical version of the command without duplicates and with a more reasonable retry count:
 
robocopy %DeploymentFiles% D:\workflow /E /IS /MOVE /XD D:\automation\api /R:5 /W:10
 
This version:
 
Moves all files and directories, including empty ones, from the source to D:\workflow.
 
Includes "same" files.
 
Excludes the D:\automation\api directory.
 
Retries up to 5 times with a 10-second wait.

You can create a .bat file to stop an application pool in IIS using the appcmd command. Here’s how:
 
1. Open Notepad (or any text editor).
 
 
2. Copy the following code and paste it into the editor:
 
@echo off
REM Replace 'DefaultAppPool' with the name of your application pool
 
set APPPOOL_NAME=DefaultAppPool
 
echo Stopping application pool: %APPPOOL_NAME%
%windir%\system32\inetsrv\appcmd stop apppool /apppool.name:%APPPOOL_NAME%
 
echo Application pool stopped.
 
 
3. Replace DefaultAppPool with the name of the application pool you want to stop.
 
 
4. Save the file with a .bat extension, for example, StopAppPool.bat.
 
 
 
To run it:
 
1. Right-click the .bat file.
 
 
2. Select Run as administrator (required for permissions to control IIS).
 
 
 
This will stop the specified application pool in IIS.
